<h2>C - malloc, free</h2>
<p>Automatic memory allocation happens when you declare a variable. It is automatic because the computer takes care of creating a block of memory to store the variable you created. Dynamic memory allocation requires that you use a function to allocate a block of memory of any size you wish and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. One of the functions used to allocate memory is malloc.</p>
