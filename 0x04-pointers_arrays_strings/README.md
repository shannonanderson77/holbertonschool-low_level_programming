<h1>Readme</h1>
<h2>C - pointers, arrays and strings</h2>
<p>A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable</p>
<p>An array is a collection of variables of the same type.</p>
<p>In C, the difference between a pointer and an array is that a pointer just stores an address whereas an array stores actual values.</p>
<p>A string is an array of characters that terminates with the null character <code>\0</code></p>
<p>Scope of variables refers to global scope: meaning the variable can be accessed by any function defined in the program or local scope: meaning the variable can be accessed only within the function where it is declared.</p>
