<h2>C - functions, nested loops</h2>
<p>Nested loops are loops within loops. A function is a group of statements that perform a task. A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function. A function prototype specifies what to give to the function and what to expect from the function. It tells the return type, the number of arguments passed to the function, the data types of each of the passed arguments and the order in which the arguments are passed to the function. Function prototype is necessary to insure that the compiler doesn't make assumptions about the actual function type. Scope of variables refers to where within a program a variable can be accessed. If the variable is defined outside of a function it is a global variable and can be accessed by any function in the program, if defined within a function the scope of that variable is limited to the function it was declared in. Header files are files with a .h extension and contains C function declarations and macro definitions that can be shared between source files. There are header files that comes with the compiler and header files can also be written by programmers. The directive <kbd>#include <header></kbd> is placed at the beginning of your C source file.</p>
<h2>gcc flags</h2>
<p>-Werror : warning option that prevents constructions that may not be errors but suggest there may be bugs in the program from compiling</p>
<p>-pedantic : checks program for conformance to GNU Fortran and produces warnings</p>
<p>-Wall : enables commonly used warning options pertaining to usage</p>
<p>-Wextra : enables some warning options for usages of language features which may be problematic</p>
